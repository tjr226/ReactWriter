# ReactWriter

Use React to draft and play with writing. Version Control for essays

### Why would this be helpful?

If something I wrote doesn't work, it's often helpful to either rewrite it completely, or start reorganizing the pieces.

React + Git provide a fantastic framework (but horrible UX) to play with writing - move components/paragraphs around, use version control to save previous writing instead of deleting it.
